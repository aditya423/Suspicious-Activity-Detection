### Artificial Intelligance
Branch of CS that is concerned with building smart & intelligent machines

### Machine Learning
Technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed

### Deep Learning
Subfield of ML that uses Artificial Neural Networks to learn from the data

## Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning? 
* Teaching machines using data 
* eg. YouTube Recommendations

### Why Python? 
* Easy
* Fast enough
* Has ML libraries
* Is cross platform

### Motivation
* AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player
* The first to defeat a Go world champion, and is arguably the strongest Go player in history

### What are Features? 
* It is a measurable piece of data that can be used for analysis
* eg. to detect the cat, features will be eyes, ears, nose, nails, etc
* Input to ML

### What are Labels?
* It is the process of identifying raw data and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine learning model can learn from it
* eg. to detect the cat or dog, labels will be cat and dog
* Output of ML

### Data Collection in ML
* Feeding data and instructing machine on what to do and how to behave is the most important aspect of ML 
* UCI Machine Learning Repository

### ML with problem understanding
* In ML, data and technique is important but equally important is identifying the type of problem 
* Supervised or Unsupervised?

### Steps in a typical ML problem
1. Problem Identification
2. Data Collection and Validation
3. Model Building
4. Feedback

## Types of ML Algorithms

### Supervised ML Algorithms
* Machine knows something beforehand
* Already tagged data
* Features and labels present

### Classification 
* It is about predicting a class or discrete values eg: male or female, true or false
* Algorithms used:
  1. Decision Tree Classification
  2. Random Forest Classification
  3. K-nearest Neighbor
  
### Regression 
* It is about predicting a quantity or continuous values eg: salary, age, price
* Algorithms used:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Polynomial Regression
  3. Support Vector Machines
  
</details>

### Unsupervised ML Algorithms
* All machine knows is the data in front of it
* Data not already tagged
* Features and labels not present 
* Training not done

### Clustering
* It is about grouping the similar data points
* Algorithms used:
  1. K-means Clustering
  2. Hierarchical Clustering

</p>
  
### Association
* It is used to find important relationship between data points
* Algorithms used:
  1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  2. Apriori
  3. Eclat

### Reinforcement ML Algorithms
* Area of ML concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximize its rewards
* It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation
* If it takes move closer to the winning it will get a positive reward 
* If it takes bad move it will get a negative reward 
* By this machine tries to learn how to play that game

## Scikit Learn
* Must download and learn ML library 
* Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis 
* Built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib
* To install: [pip install sklearn]

<hr>

## Note 
* Half dataset used for Training the model and half dataset used for Testing the model
